#### Note:

The Shale Hills DOC model was set up using the spatially explicit mode. 

To run the example, first install CVODE in your BioRT-Flux-PIHM directory:

```shell
$ make cvode
```

Then compile the spatially explicit model:

```shell
$ make biort-flux-pihm
```

Run the example:

```shell
./biort-flux-pihm ShaleHills_DOC
```
